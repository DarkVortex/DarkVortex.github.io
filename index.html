			<h3>Departmental Engagement</h3>
			<p>Aside from the typical coursework, I take part in other departmental activities in order to broaden my skillset and gain experience. I am a Teaching Assistant (TA) for different Mechanical Engineering classes, such as Thermodynamics and Dynamics. Additionally, I work as a TA in the University of Delaware Design Studio &ndash; a makerspace open to student use.</p>
			<p>I also do research in the University of Delaware Information and Decision Science (IDS) Lab! The IDS Lab is run by Dr. Andreas Malikopoulos. Here, I work on the University of Delaware Scaled Smart City (UDSSC). The goal of the UDSSC is to implement and test scale models of smart, connected vehicles with a connected city. Autonomous driving algorithms can be designed and refined, without the cost of full-scale vehicles.</p>
			<p>Additionally, I am the President of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) at the University of Delaware. As a Registered Student Organization, ASME strives to push Mechanical Engineering students past theory and classwork. We do build and design projects, take part in international competitions, and more!</p>
